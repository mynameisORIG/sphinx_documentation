1. What Is Splunk, and How Does It Work?
###############################################

Splunk is a real-time data analytics platform that ingests machine-generated data from various sources like:

* logs
* metrics
* applications

It indexes this data into searchable events, enabling powerful querying, monitoring, and visulization through tis Search Processing language (SPL)

2. Can you Explain the Key Components of Splunk's Architecture?
#######################################################################

* Forwarders
 * collect and send data
* Indexers
 * store and index Data
* Search Heads
 * allow users to search and visualize

3. What are the different types of splunk forwarders, and how do they function
########################################################################################

* Universal Forwarders (UF)
 * lightweight; send raw data
 * installed on endpoints, servers, or applications
* Heavy Forwarders
 * processes and filters data before forwarding
* Intermediate Forwarders
 * placed between other forwarders and Indexers
 * used for load balancing, centeralized routing, or traffic control

Each server different data collection needs, ensuring flexible and efficent data ingestion across varied environments.

4. Which Port Numbers are Commonly Used by Splunk
#######################################################

* **8089** for management
 * UNCSO uses 8900
* **9997** for data forwarding
* **8000** for web interface
* **514** for syslog

6. What are the different types of Splunk Licenses available
######################################################################


* Enterprise License
 * Unlimited indexing with full features.
* Free License
 * Limited to 500MB/day with reduced functionality.
* Trial License
 * Temporary access to Enterprise features.

9. What is a Summary Index in Splunk, and How is it Used?
#################################################################

A Summary Index in Splunk stores precomputed results from searches, making repeated queries faster. It's userful for tren analysis and reporting where real-time data is not required. For Instance, summarizing daily log volumes help reduce search load

10. What is splunk db connect, and how does it work?
#########################################################

Splunk DB Connect is a plugin that integrates relational databases with Splunk. It allows SQL-based data extraction and joins it with machine data. This unified view supports deeper analytics, like correlatin transactional data with server logs.

11. What are Buckets in Splunk, and Can you Explain the Bucket Lifecycle?
################################################################################

Buckets in Splunk are storage directories that contain indexed data. They pass through distinct lifecycle stages:

* **Hot**: Data is actively written.
* **Warm**: Data is no longer actively written but frequently accessed.
* **Cold**: Archived data, accessed occasionally.
* **Frozen**: Data is either deleted or archived externally.

This lifecycle ensures efficient storage management and quick data retrieval.

12. What type of dashboards can be created in splunk?
############################################################

* **Real-Time Dashboards**: Display live-streaming data.
* **Static Dashboards**: Present a fixed data snapshot for a given timeframe.
* **Interactive Dashboards**: Offer user-driven filtering and drill-down capabilities.

Dashboards enhance visibility and enable quick, actionable insights across datasets.

13. What are the Different Search Modes Supported in Splunk?
###################################################################

* **Fast**: Prioritizes speed; omits some event details
* **Smart**: Balances speed and depth by adapting to query complexity.
* **Verbose**: Provides complete event information, including raw data.

Search mode selection directly afects performance and data granularity.

14. What is sourcetype in Splunk, and Why is it Important?
##############################################################

A sourcetype in Splunk defines the format of incoming data. It ensures the data is correctly parsed, indexed, and searchable.

**Example**: Assiging the **access_combined** sourcetype to Apache web logs allow consistent field extraction

15. What are the various types of data inputs in Splunk?
###########################################################

* Files and directories
* Syslog
* APIs
* Scripted Inputs

16. What are the Key Configuration Files in Splunk?
##########################################################

* **inputs.conf**: Defines data inputs
* **props.conf**: Manages data parsing
* **transforms.conf**: Handles data transformation and field extraction.

18. How can you clear search History in Splunk?
###################################################

.. code-block:: console

    rm -rf $SPLUNK_HOME/var/log/splunk/searchhistory.log

21. What Is a Splunk Universal Forwarder, and How Does It Differ from a Heavy Forwarder?
################################################################################################

* **Universal Forwarder (UF)**: Lightweight agent with minimal resource usage; used for forwarding raw data without parsing.
* **Heavy Forwarder (HF)**: Full Splunk instance with parsing, indexing, and filtering capabilities; suitable for preprocessing large datasets. 

Key Differences:

* **Data Parsing**: UF doesnâ€™t parse; HF does. 
* **Resource Usage**: UF is resource-light; HF is resource-intensive. 
* **Use Cases**: UF for large-scale data collection; HF for intelligent data routing and transformation. 

23. Can You Explain the Role of the Deployment Server in Splunk?
####################################################################

The Deployment Server is a centralized configuration management tool in Splunk.

* It pushes configurations and updates to forwarders. 
* It ensures consistency across all nodes by managing apps, inputs, and outputs. 
* It scales efficiently, supporting thousands of clients. 

Used primarily in large-scale environments to reduce manual configuration effort.

24. What Is the Role of Metadata in Splunk, and How Is It Used in Indexing?
################################################################################

Metadata helps categorize and retrieve data in Splunk:

* **Host**: Source machine. 
* **Source**: File or stream providing the data. 
* **Sourcetype**: Format used for field extraction. 
* **Index Mapping**: Organizes data into index buckets for efficient querying. 

Splunk uses metadata during indexing to enhance search speed and relevance.

27. How Do the Stats and Eventstats Commands Differ in Splunk?
####################################################################

Both stats and eventstats are essential commands in Splunk used for performing statistical computations on event data. However, they serve distinct purposes in the data pipeline, especially in how they treat the original dataset. The key differences are outlined below:

.. list-table:: Commands
   :widths: 25 25 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Feature
     - Stats
     - Eventstats
   * - Operation
     - Generates statistical summaries based on grouped events.
     - Adds computed statistical results back to individual events.
   * - Scope
     - Results in aggregated output; drops original event data.
     - Retains original events and appends calculated fields to them.
   * - Use Case
     - Use for standalone reports and dashboards.
     - Use for enhancing event details without altering the dataset.
