This works very simarly with how python handles it's functions

In the code below we create a function named **addTwo** where the num is the input variable we ask later on.
When we execute the function **addTwo** we put in the `number` 5. This will result in the output of 7.

.. code-block:: console

    function addTwo(num){
        return num + 2
    }

    console.log(addTwo(5))
